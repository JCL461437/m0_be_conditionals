# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It is useful to use a conditional in your code whenver you need to create unique branches or responses to different situations that can arise within the program (those situations designed by you intentionally). 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
If I could do the assignment over, I would have expreimented with using the Ruby gets method to allow user input instead of having to manually go in and change the value of the variables. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Honestly the most satisfying thing about todays work was finally becoming comfortable with the git workflow and "pushing" information from the local repository to the remote one. Having to repeat the work flow and then push the information forced me to become comfortable with it, giving me the necessary practice to finally grasp the concept.
